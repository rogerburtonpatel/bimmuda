Be warned - this is by far the most difficult song in the entire dataset to transcribe. I tried my best, but I think my transcription is poor. Here are my notes:

- I think the entire song is tuned slightly sharp, on purpose. It sounds like the root note is between a G and G sharp.

- I don't know what the key is. It doesn't sound like G major or G minor, but some other type of scale I don't recognise. I did not put any key signature for this reason. 

- My sense of pitch is completely lost with this song. Throughout the score you'll see I keep switching from G to G sharp as the root note in the melodies. I have no idea what the right pitches are. 

Good luck with this one. This song is such a headache
